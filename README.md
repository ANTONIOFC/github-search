# GithubSearch

This project was based on the Brad Traversy's project hosted on https://github.com/bradtraversy/githubsearch.git, following his video course on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83MLQ1VsKI). I used Bootstrap 4 to style the front-end.

The project was also hosted on my personnal Firebase account and can be accessed from https://githubsearch-9452a.firebaseapp.com/
